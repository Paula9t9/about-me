# About-me
This repository is a project about me. This is a test of my development skills starting from zero. Through the several commit's that will be submitted, I will be able to track my progress. This project is a combination of HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript; the two latter languages are to be linked into the index.html and function smoothly
