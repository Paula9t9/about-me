        <h3>Brief history about me</h3>
        <p>After serving four years and an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps, I decided to attend college to obtain a finance degree. During my senior year, I was exposed to coding when I had to build an HTML webpage for a class. I decided to work for some years to save money in order to get a Computer Science degree. After having been a financial advisor and an auto claims adjuster, I am now studying for my vocation as a software developer. </p>
